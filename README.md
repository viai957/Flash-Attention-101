# FlashAttention From Scratch 🚀

## **Overview**
This repository is a deep dive into **FlashAttention**, implemented from first principles using **Triton**, **CUDA Kernels**, and **PyTorch**. The goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the FlashAttention mechanism by breaking it down step-by-step and implementing it from scratch. 

Key highlights:
- Mathematical derivation with **handwritten notes** 📜
- **Jupyter Notebook scratchpad** with explanations at each step
- **Triton and CUDA kernel implementations** ⚡
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing naive PyTorch vs. Triton implementations 🔥
- **Google Colab Notebook** for easy experimentation 🎯


## **Work Under Progress** 🛠️
- [x] **Sliding Window Attention** 
- [ ] **MoBA (Mixture of Block Attention)** to enhance block-wise computations for better performance.

## **Understanding FlashAttention** 🧠
### **1. What is FlashAttention?**
FlashAttention is an **optimized attention mechanism** that significantly reduces the memory overhead of self-attention by:
- **Computing attention in blocks** (reducing memory footprint)
- **Leveraging hardware-efficient optimizations** (such as fused operations)
- **Reducing redundant computation** while maintaining accuracy

This makes FlashAttention particularly effective for **large transformer models**, as it enables scaling without running into memory bottlenecks.

### **2. Mathematical Derivation** ✏️
The repository includes **handwritten notes** with a step-by-step breakdown of the derivation. Key components covered:
- Standard **Self-Attention** formulation
- How FlashAttention **optimizes memory usage**
- **Rewriting the attention mechanism** in a more hardware-efficient way

You can find these in the `notes/` folder and the **flash-attention-notes.ipynb** notebook.

## **Implementation Details** ⚙️
### **1. PyTorch Naive Implementation**
The first step is implementing self-attention **naively** in PyTorch. This serves as a baseline to:
- Understand standard attention computations
- Compare performance later

This is included in the `scratch-pad.ipynb` notebook.

### **2. Triton Implementation** ⚡
**Triton** is used to optimize the attention computation with:
- **Parallelized operations** to reduce bottlenecks
- **Optimized memory access** to improve efficiency
- **Fused computation** to minimize redundant operations

This is covered in `triton/` and `triton-scratch-pad.ipynb`.

### **3. CUDA Kernel Implementation** 🎯
For an even deeper understanding, **custom CUDA kernels** are written to:
- Gain fine-grained control over memory layout
- Optimize performance beyond what Triton provides
- Experiment with GPU-specific optimizations

This is covered in the `cuda/` directory.
